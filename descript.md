# **Bean Counter - an app for coffee nerds**

## **The Vision:**
> I've heard it said often that coffee shouldn't be just a drink, but an experience. The moment it becomes less about the caffeine fix and more about:
>
> - The way it's prepared 
> - Its natural flavor
> - Its point of origin
> - Any combination of these
> 
> is when you start becoming a "coffee nerd."
>
> The problem is ***breaking into the coffee world can be a bit of a learning curve***.
>
> There's so much information, so many opinions, and so much practice that can go into making quality coffee.
>
> As a barista and coffee nerd, I struggle to retain all the information I've learned about what different regions taste like, how to make a cappuccino vs. a cortado, or the best grind size for each brewing method. I know for a beginner, the amount you need to know to craft espresso can be high, and for an expert, you aren't content with not learning more.
>
> So I decided to make an app. By a coffee snob for coffee snobs.
>
> This app will be your one-stop shop for coffee information. The full list of features is seen below, but the gist of it is contained in the 3 R's:
> - Recipes
> - Roasters & Shops
> - Resources
>
> Whether you were just onboarded at a local coffee shop or you snort coffee grounds for fun, Bean Counter is for you. It is for the coffee consumer and the coffee provider.

    - Emphasis on getting background running first
    -
### **Recipes:**
1. Research most popular styles & brewing methods of coffee/espresso, how they're made, and best practices
2. Ditto for the lesser known ones as time goes on
### **Roasters & Shops:**

### **Resources:**

### **Future Goals:**
1. Log-in system
    - Subscribe to shops
        - For baristas of that coffee shop to have a "Barista Bible"
        - For average coffee-goer to see "menus"
            - *Purpose:* To know ahead of time what the baristas are trained in and specialty items
    - "Business" accounts for coffee roasters and shops
        - Edit viewable menu (rotate drinks, etc.)
        - Alter cookie-cutter methods to reflect their ratios, times, brewing methods, etc.
